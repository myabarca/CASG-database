# CASG-database-search
Files for the development of a database and search tool for the geology collections at the California Academy of Sciences. 

These files were developed locally with a xampp stack, so the actual search functionality doesn't work on this Github Page. But you can at least click around! Which is admittedly not as satisfying as searching through specimen data.
