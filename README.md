# CASG-database-search
Files for the development of a database and search tool for the geology collections at the California Academy of Sciences. 

These files were developed locally with a xampp stack, so the dynamic search functionality doesn't work on this static Github Page. But you can at least click around! Which is admittedly not as satisfying as searching through specimen data. Until the project is available on a public server with database access, you can click around here: myabarca.github.io/CASG-database-search and view images of what a search would output.
